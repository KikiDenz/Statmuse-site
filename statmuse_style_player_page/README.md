# StatMuse-style Player Page (Fixed + Career High 3PM)
- Fixes points so 3PM always counts as 3: **PTS = 2*max(FGM âˆ’ 3PM, 0) + 3*3PM + FTM**
- Adds **Career High 3PM** to the Career Highs bar.
- Includes dark mode and collapsible Add Game section.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser (or use Live Server in VS Code). Drop your PNGs into `assets/` and update the filenames in the TEAMS/PLAYERS sections if needed.
